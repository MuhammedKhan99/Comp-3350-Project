**TEAM-11: VIRTUAL STICKY NOTES**

The purpose of our project is to provide a personal information organization
app to facilitate the recording of various little notes a user may have. It
emulates a board or desk with a variety of sticky notes that can be moved
around to fit the user's liking. It persists the data of what boards the user
has and what notes are attached to that board between sessions and uses an
account system to accomplish this. There are various customization options,
such as colour-setting and password-changing, to make the user-experience as
enjoyable as possible.

To run the project on the AndroidStudio emulator, first clone the repository 
into the directory of your choice:


Then open AndroidStudio and go to ```File -> Open```. Then go to 
virtual-sticky-notes-11/VirtualStickyNotes and open up the VirtualStickyNotes project.
Ensure the emulator's current device is a Nexus 7 running on Android M API Level 23, 
and run the app by going to Run -> Run 'app', pressing Shift + F10, or by pressing the 
green play button in the toolbar at the upper right. Ensure that the app is being run 
and not any of the test suites.
