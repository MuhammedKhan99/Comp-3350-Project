Virtual Sticky Notes
====================

Detailed below are the Vision, Features, and User Stories for our a virtual 
sticky note app. 

Vision
------

This project is an app designed to facilitate the creation and management of 
personal information snippets, such as appointments, shopping lists, 
to-do lists, or schedules.

These small tidbits will be written on virtualized sticky-notes, simulating a 
desk environment. We seek to supplement this with a range of organization 
capabilities, such as creating boards, similar to folders, that can store a
number of sticky-notes created by the users. These will have permanence, even 
across devices, as they will be tied to a personal account and not to the device
itself. 

The goal is to not only have these sticky-note-style items be used by a single 
individual, but also to invite friends or colleagues to collaborate together, 
such as for the development of a project. The creator of the board can assign 
administrators, editors, and viewers to manage who can and cannot perform 
certain actions in regards to boards. Administrators will be able to add and 
delete users from boards, editors will be able to add, delete, and edit 
sticky-notes, while viewers will only be able to see the board. These features 
will be implemented in a friendly user interface that is intuitive to use with 
minimal instruction, supporting the fact that this application is designed to be
used by anyone.

Our target user base is wide, though we envision this as being particularly 
useful for development teams to emulate sticky-note-style collaboration from a 
variety of users, without the need of all participants being in a single 
location. However, it could also be used by anyone seeking an app to organize 
their personal items by themselves or a small group of their friends.

All modern phones come with a built-in application that allows their user to 
create text notes that can be edited and deleted, but this app will allow a more
in-depth customization and organization interface. It expands on a tool already 
used by many while remaining intuitive and usable to anyone. This ensures that 
users will find a purpose for this app, regardless of why they decide to use it.

We will know our project is successful when our app can create and facilitate 
the access of user accounts, store information in virtual sticky-notes, attach 
these virtual notes to virtual boards, and to share virtual notes/boards with a 
number of other users while assigning roles to them. The aforementioned 
functionality should be responsive in that when an input is received, the 
processing and delay should take no longer than 100 milliseconds, to lead to a 
pleasurable user experience. This will indicate that our original vision for 
this app has been achieved and realized.
